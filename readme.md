## Hello visiting scientists. I'm Xuan Binh a.k.a Spring Nuance
- :zap: I am currently a PhD in multiscale modelling for metal characterization and hydrogen embrittlement at Aachen Univeristy
- :zap: I studied AI and machine learning for my Master's program at Aalto Univeristy. My Bachelor is in Computational Engineering
- :zap: I have adequate experience in applied exisitng ML models for solving/aiding material engineering problems
- :zap: On macroscale, I mostly use Abaqus (Both Implicit and Explicit) for research, and to some extent COMSOL Multiphysics
- :zap: On microscale, the standard pipeline is MTEX in Matlab, Dream3D/Neper, crystal plasticity such as DAMASK or CPFEM
- :zap: For SWE side, I have adequate experience in optimization, workflow design, and supercomputing service.
